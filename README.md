# Level Set Alogorithm Based on Chan Vese Model
# Guide
This is an MATLAB implementation by HSW in 2015.4.12 (HARBIN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY). But there was several mistakes on the original code and I fixed them to make sure it can process properly.

The entrance is demo_CV.m, and you can run it with any chosen policy of initialization.
